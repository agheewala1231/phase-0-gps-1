I think I was struggling pushing and pulling in git and how github works.

John explained how Github works and the purpose of it. I believe i need to keep playing with github to understand it fully.

Asked John how Github works and how to make someone a collaborators.

Remembering the commands i think is my biggest challenge.

I was pretty nervous because i didn't know how it was gonna go or if I was gonna be ready for this or not or even if i was gonna hold the group back or not. I believe everything went fine and Mark and I were on the same page for most of the part.
